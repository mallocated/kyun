# キュン | The worst text editor yet
[![Made with Pain](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Pain-red.svg)](https://shields.io/) 

Kyun is a ***low productivity***, ***low fidelity***, ***low customizablity*** text editor that has its focus firm on ***user discomfort*** - specifically made for writing uwu-style cutesy text. It is based on ![hecto](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial), a great text editor for learning purposes, by Philipp Flenker and licensed under ![CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
